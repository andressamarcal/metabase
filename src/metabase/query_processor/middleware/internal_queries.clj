(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.internal-queries
  "Middleware that handles special `internal` type queries. `internal` queries are implementeed directly by Clojure
  functions, and do not neccesarily need to query a database to provide results; by default, they completely skip
  the rest of the normal QP pipeline. `internal` queries should look like the following:

    {:type :internal
     :fn   \"metabase.audit.pages.dashboards/table\"
     :args []} ; optional vector of args to pass to the fn above

  To run an `internal` query, you must have superuser permissions, and the function itself must be tagged as an
  `:internal-query-fn`. This middleware will automatically resolve the function as appropriate, loading its namespace
  if needed. The function should return a map with two keys, `:metadata` and `:results`:

    (defn ^:internal-query-fn table []
      {:metadata [[:title {:display_name \"Title\", :base_type :type/Text}]
                  [:count {:display_name \"Count\", :base_type :type/Integer}]]
       :results  [{:title \"Birds\", :count 2}
                  {:title \"Cans\", :count 2}]})

  *  `:metadata` is used to provide the normal `:columns` and `:cols` metadata that would come back with an MBQL or
     native query.
  *  `:results` should be a sequence of maps similar to the results of `jdbc/query`. They will be automatically
     converted to the format expected by the frontend (a `rows` key that is an array of arrays)  by this middleware."
